# mnist_with_numpy
A simple machine learning model for recognizing hand written digits from the famous MNist data set.

This model only makes use of numpy to handle math operations and does not use external machine learning libraries such as pytorch. The only other library used is matplotlib to plot the accuracy graphs of the model.
